This is a project on spam messege detection on SMS Spam Collection Dataset. (You can fiud the dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

This project uses a rigorous data preprocessing steps followed by feature extraction using both bag of words and tf-tdf. Then a series of machine learning algorithms are tested in order to find best performing model. We got the best result on Multinomial Naive Bayes using tf-idf vectorizer. (Accuracy: 95.35% and precision: 100%)
